Portfolio site for mom

## Goals

Has login and signUp

1. user profile with upload function, user can upload their artwork and have an year made, description, and title.

2. Home page displays All users, and you can click inside to see all their work.

3. this will ideally try to have an react-i18next, for localization

## Pages Setup

1. Homepage, like instagram home page for now showing all the user content
2. Upload page, this is your management, upload pictures, change titles, add a descriptions, and delete, and edit your profile
3. login logout

4. Make instagram home page!

5) to avoid duplicated usernames when creating artworks collection docs, maybe just use uid because it's unique to each users.

6) learn instragram layout divs/containers

7) have an open route that insta/user/34JN\$#5234LJKN5334 so anyone can view the project.

8) ideally would be nice to sort by upload date or have user select a sorting method.

Could: Homepage showcases other user's art

Could: Should have a way to share your work, using your uid as route.
